# Adamant-console

Adamant-console is Command-line utilities to interact with ADAMANT blockchain. It allows you to run commands like send tokens, create new address and get information.

## Understanding interaction with ADAMANT blockchain

ADAMANT has _only secure API_, and you cannot transfer passphrase to node to make any action with wallet. Instead, node _requires signed transaction_ to make any action.

Adamant-console connects to ADAMANT nodes on your choice (set in configuration file), it can be any node, locally installed on your machine, or from other side of the Earth. As Console doesnâ€™t transfer passphrases to nodes, it's safe to connect to any node. Node you connect should have [API enabled](https://medium.com/adamant-im/how-to-run-your-adamant-node-on-ubuntu-990e391e8fcc#fe7e).

You can use any programming languages to interact with Adamant-console, like PHP, Python, NodeJS, bash.
