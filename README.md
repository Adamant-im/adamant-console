Command-line utilities to work with ADAMANT blockchain.

# Understanding interaction with ADAMANT blockchain

ADAMANT node is based on Lisk 0.9 code, but with important difference. ADAMANT have *only secure API*, and you cannot transfer passphrase to node to make any action with wallet, like Lisk 0.9 does. Instead, node *requires signed transaction* to make any action.
So, to interact with ADAMANT blockcahin, you do not need ADAMANT node installed, while you still can do that.
It is easier and better to use Adamant-console for interactions. Adamant-console is command-line interface utility that gets command to make an action and returns result info in JSON.

You can use any programming languages to interact with Adamant-console, like PHP, Python, NodeJS, bash.
